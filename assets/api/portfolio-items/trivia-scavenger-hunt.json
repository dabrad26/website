    "shortDescription": "Trivia Scavenger Hunt allows a group leader, teacher or anyone to create a free scavenger hunt that they can use to help students or any participants learn more about an area with a fun trivia based scavenger hunt. Anyone (groups, classes, schools...) is free to use this app and create scavenger hunts. You can create a free scavenger using the tools below and share the Scavenger Hunt ID with your group or class.",
    "longDescription": "Users will need to solve the trivia questions, go to the location and use the App to see if they found it (using GPS), once they have found the location the app will give them more information about the location (set by the creator) and award a badge for that location. Once the user has found all the locations and collected all the badges the creator of the scavenger hunt is notified via email (optional) and can see who has completed the hunt.\n\nThis is a great way to get users familiar with an area or learn more about the area. It is free to create a scavenger hunt and the app is free to download by the users.\n\nTrivia Scavenger Hunt had three main parts to its development. The app was developed for the Android platform in Java with the frontend being in Android XML. The application used precise GPS locations to get the userâ€™s current location and compare it to what is considered in the acceptable range of the answer (set by the creator). The app takes advantage of Shared Preferences to save all data needed to allow the user to start and stop the app without losing any badges and to only have to enter the Scavenger Hunt ID once. The second part was the database, the database was a MySQL database that contained each scavenger hunt. The PHP forms and handlers on this website were designed to allow the creator to easily create a scavenger hunt for their group by filling out the form. The system also allowed them to go back and change a scavenger hunt if needed using a pass phrase and the ID generated by the system. The database and data collection/editing side was written in PHP using a MySQL database with JQuery, JavaScript and CSS for form handling and data verification. The final part of this project was the Coordinate Finder which was a JavaScript based page using the Google Maps API to allow the user to easily get the coordinates from Google Map and visually view the radius on either the Satellite view or the Map view of Google Maps.",
