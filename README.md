# David Bradshaw's Personal Website

This is the FE for my personal website and portfolio.

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Deploy

The CI system will build and deploy to the web hosting server.
