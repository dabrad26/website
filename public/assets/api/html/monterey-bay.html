  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>For our Projects in IXD class we were given a real-world client to work with. Our client was Monterey Bay Aquarium in Monterey, California.  We met with our client to understand their needs and made a plan for researching, testing, and designing the navigation changes the client wanted.  During the class we also decided to take on the “Welcome Back” page for the client to show a full story between the navigation and a user who needs to return to the aquarium after they reopen.  The navigation changes were the primary deliverable for the client, but the Welcome Back flow was an additional offering showcasing what could be done as they reopen and what could possibly help customers feel safe returning to the aquarium and improve their experience of purchasing tickets and returning to the aquarium.</p>
  <h2>The Team</h2>

  <p>This project was done with a total of five students from the Pratt Institute for the Projects in Information Experience Design class.  This class connects groups of students with a real-world client that the group deals directly with to perform a specific task defined by the client. For our group we were split into two main teams. MJ and Nora took on the role of performing research and usability testing of current and new designs.  Myself, Raunak and Yuan focused on creating the designs and prototypes that took data from research and integrated them into the final designs.  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic we were forced to be completely remote for working with the team.</p>
  <h2>Process</h2>
  <p>This project was conducted over fifteen weeks and included meeting with the client to gather business rules and goals of the website, recruiting participants, analyzing data, documenting findings and coming up with recommendations.  The entire process ended with our team presenting our findings to the client.  The entire process was done remotely due to COVID-19 which added additional challenges with working with teammates across time zones and dealing with technical issues with participants.</p>
  <h3>Collaboration Between the Team</h3>

    <span>Collaboration on Slack and Zoom</span>
  </div>
  <p>The current situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic forced all aspects of this project to be done remotely.  For collaborating with the team in this project we utilized <a href="https://slack.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Slack</a> for constant collaboration and check-ins and used <a href="https://zoom.us" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Zoom</a> for any needed in-person meetings.  We had group members on both sides of the world which added some complexity with finding meeting times that worked for all members.  However, with collaboration software we were able to complete all needs and still work closely together over the different time zones.  For working on documents and tasks lists we utilized <a href="https://www.google.com/docs/about/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Google Shared Drive and Google’s office software</a> for same time editing of documents and reviewing content.</p>
  <h3>Product Management</h3>

    <span>Product Management via Trello</span>
  </div>
  <p>For keeping track of work during the course of this project we utilized <a href="https://trello.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Trello</a> for managing sprints and work to perform during each sprint.  Sprints were well defined at the beginning of the course and then sub-tasks were created as each sprint started to assign tasks to the appropriate person.  Trello was useful to ensure insight into the project and know the status of other members.</p>
  <h3>Recruitment for Research</h3>

  </div>
  <p>For the research side we started by getting insight into possible visitors to the aquarium. To do this we created a <a href="https://www.google.com/forms/about/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Google Form</a> that we sent out to all our networks and had the aquarium send out.  Using this we were able to get a wide range of insight into how people felt about returning to aquariums and museums after the pandemic.  Individuals who agreed to further research were contacted directly and usability testing on the current website’s Welcome Back page and navigation was done to better understand where the site currently stood.</p>
  <h3>Research Approaches</h3>
  <div class="image-group">
    <img src="/assets/api/html/assets/monterey-bay-first-click.png" alt="First Click Test Findings" />
    <span>First Click Test Findings</span>
  </div>
  <p>Multiple approaches were taken to research.  We started by performing a competitive analysis of similar websites to see how others have approached this problem and then started testing the current site via moderated and unmoderated approaches.  This included first-click tests, moderated user testing and unmoderated user testing.  We also applied a basic information architecture test to the navigation structure to test the current setup.</p>
  <p>After performing these tests we were able to take the top findings for usability and incorporate them into our recommended designs.  This focused on the navigation of the site but we also wanted to ensure the navigation told a full story of a user completing a goal; in our case visiting the aquarium after it has reopened.  To test this we also designed a new welcome back flow that incorporated existed features from the site and new ones to ensure users can complete the tasks and visit the aquarium with all the needed information.</p>
  <h2>Navigation Usability Issues</h2>
  <div class="image-group">
    <img src="/assets/api/html/assets/monterey-bay-current-nav.png" alt="Current Navigation" />
    <span>Current Navigation</span>
  </div>
  <p>After testing the current navigation, we identified a few areas that could use some improvements.  This included some areas that the client identified during our first meeting.  We had several iterations of the navigation throughout testing and after additional usability testing on our recommendations we made more changes which resulted in the final version below.  This version addressed the following usability concerns:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Large header taking up most of the page</li>
    <li>Additional clicks needed to open and close</li>
    <li>Clicking outside to close could click an item and change pages</li>
    <li>Image cards on navigation are large and not based on current navigation</li>
    <li>Hard to know that the primary nav text is clickable</li>
    <li>Children nav items are not understood to be nested</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Final Recommendations</h3>

  <h2>"Welcome Back" Pages</h2>
  <div class="image-group">
    <img src="/assets/api/html/assets/monterey-bay-journey-map.png" alt="Journey Map" />
    <span>Welcome Back Journey Map</span>
  </div>
  <p>For the “Welcome Back” pages we started with a user persona and then applied a journey map to our personas.  This map is seen above; using this we were able to guide our design decisions and understand what the customers needed to complete their goals.  Using this and our competitive analysis we were able to create a flow that was integrated with our new navigation seen above.  This was tested and iterated on many times until the final design was created.  The final design includes usability findings against the current website’s information structure, element sizes, and other tester’s feedback and comments.</p>
  <p>The final design tries to ensure that safety measures are clearly presented to the user and are understood with minimal reading.  Showcasing clearly what is open vs close is also incorporated through the new exhibits flow and we have added a “post-purchase” experience that helps the customer find useful information and to keep exploring the site after the purchase is complete.  This includes a virtual map they can send to their phone, finding places to visit in the city and what to do the day they arrive.  </p>
  <h3>Final Design</h3>
  <div class="image-group">

  </div>
  <p>The final design can be seen above as an animated GIF. You can also view the <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/HgDyGAd8S1P3PqjJGqmWli/Wireframe-Family-Story-edit?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=39%3A790&viewport=-2122%2C608%2C0.6300068497657776&scaling=scale-down-width" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Figma prototype</a>. Design files and static PDFs are also available at the end of this page.  From the design you can see the upfront information on safety and exhibits via the “Welcome Back” page.  The checkout experience is also a new flow based on other similar sites that now require time-based entry.  The post experience provides a single flow between information that may be useful on your visit or on the day of travel. This allows the customer to browse through recommended pages and information and be fully prepared on the day they visit. This information is also emailed to them and is quickly available to share to your phone or family members.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In the end we felt our findings were strong and provided actionable recommendations that could be implemented by Monterey Bay Aquarium.  Our usability issues and redesign of the navigation were well received by the client during our final presentation and hopefully can prove useful if they are able to implement the new designs.  Overall, their site was easy to use and our findings were not critical but could greatly improve the user’s experience on the site if they choose to implement them.  If we were able to continue with this project we would want to try and improve the flows from the mega navigation and connect them to complete full experiences and journeys across the website.  We enjoyed the experience of working with a real client and found Monterey Bay Aquarium very open and willing to help in our endeavors to improve their navigation and website.  We look forward to seeing their future site as they work to improve their experience and welcome people back to the aquarium.</p>
