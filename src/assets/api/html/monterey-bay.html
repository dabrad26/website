  <p>This project was done with a total of five students from the Pratt Institute for the Projects in Information Experience Design class.  This class connects groups of students with a real-world client that the group deals directly with to perform a specific task defined by the client. For our group we were split into two main teams. MJ and Nora took on the role of performing research and usability testing of current and new designs.  Myself, Raunak and Yuan focused on creating the designs and prototypes that took data from research and integrated them into the final designs.  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic we were forced to be completely remote for working with the team.</p>
  <h2>Process</h2>
  <p>This project was conducted over six weeks and included meeting with the client to gather business rules and goals of the website, recruiting participants, analyzing data, documenting findings and coming up with recommendations.  The entire process ended with our team presenting our findings to the client.  The entire process was done remotely due to COVID-19 which added additional challenges with working with teammates across time zones and dealing with technical issues with participants.</p>
  <h3>Collaboration Between the Team</h3>

  <p>The current situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic forced all aspects of this project to be done remotely.  For collaborating with the team in this project we utilized <a href="https://slack.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Slack</a> for constant collaboration and check-ins and used <a href="https://zoom.us" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Zoom</a> for any needed in-person meetings.  We had group members on both sides of the world which added some complexity with finding meeting times that worked for all members.  However, with collaboration software we were able to complete all needs and still work closely together over the different time zones.  For working on documents and tasks lists we utilized <a href="https://www.google.com/docs/about/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Google Shared Drive and Google’s office software</a> for same time editing of documents and reviewing content.</p>
  <h3>Product Management</h3>

  </div>
  <p>For keeping track of work during the course of this project we utilized <a href="https://trello.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Trello</a> for managing sprints and work to perform during each sprint.  Sprints were well defined at the beginning of the course and then sub-tasks were created as each sprint started to assign tasks to the appropriate person.  Trello was useful to ensure insight into the project and know the status of other members.</p>
  <h3>Recruitment</h3>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In the end we felt our findings were strong and provided actionable recommendations that could be implemented by Monterey Bay Aquarium.  Our usability issues and redesign of the Mega-navigation were well received by the client during our final presentation and hopefully can prove useful if they are able to implement the new designs.  Overall, their site was easy to use and our findings were not critical but could greatly improve the user’s experience on the site if they choose to implement them.  If we were able to continue with this project we would want to try and improve the flows from the mega navigation and connect them to complete full experiences and journeys across the website.  We enjoyed the experience of working with a real client and found Monterey Bay Aquarium very open and willing to help in our endeavors to improve their navigation and website.  We look forward to seeing their future site as they work to improve their experience and welcome people back to the aquarium.</p>
