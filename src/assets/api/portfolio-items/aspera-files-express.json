  "shortDescription": "While working for IBM I worked on a new project called Aspera Files Express. Aspera Files is an enterprise file management and sharing application that utilizes Aspera FASP. This new Files Express was a redesign on top of the same API used by Aspera Files. This new design was a simpler design that utilized a new UX direction. It offered support for sending and receiving packages and requesting packages.",
  "longDescription": "For this project, my role was working as a front-end developer working closely with a design team to ensure proper user interaction and ensuring that the implementation matched the visual design comps created by the design team responsible for Aspera Files. This project was originally a demo I was working on based on a new design from the UX team. This project worked perfectly and was well received at demos and quickly was added as an offering of Aspera Files.",
