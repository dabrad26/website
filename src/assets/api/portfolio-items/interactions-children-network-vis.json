    "shortDescription": "For this project I explored the social interactions between primary school children and their peers. A!er reading over the findings from 'High-Resolution Measurements of Face-to-Face Contact Patterns in a Primary School'. I wanted to see how students interact with peers outside of their grade level. For example, how many interactions does a first grader have with a third grader, as well as see if there are any interesting trends that might exist between grade hierarchy and social interactions with peers outside of their grade.",
    "longDescription": "With my data loaded I had a giant blob of color on the screen. This was not very useful in its current format. I experimented with the different layouts as described in the book on pages 56-76 of 'Mastering Gephi Network Visualization'. You can see the experiments in Figure 1 below. This rendered different visualizations of the data in useful collections. For my final layout I went with Yifan Hu which is a force-based algorithm with a performance gain.",
