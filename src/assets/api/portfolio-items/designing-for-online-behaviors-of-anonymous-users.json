  "shortDescription": "User Experience professionals are tasked with finding a balance of online interactions that remain civil and open depending on the use case of what they are designing.  This balancing act needs to consider the psychological influences that online users have when given the ability to interact with other users either anonymously or dehumanized.",
  "longDescription": "This study for User Experience professionals is becoming more critical as technology starts to replace or offer virtual versions of all interactions that humans have.  With the growing move to the online world cyberbullying and “trolling” are becoming a constant problem that does not just effect people online but can leads to mental hardship that hurts individuals in the real world.",
