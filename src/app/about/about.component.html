            My name is David Bradshaw and I am passionate about creating amazing user interfaces!
            My background is in Computer Science but after working on web UIs for several years
            I have fallen in love with design.

            I try to blend together the best of both worlds of coding enterprise level web applications
            while working closely on the experience of the user and visuals.  I am always trying to
            improve all my skills and consider my self a lifelong learner!

            I currently work on enterprise level web applications with a focus on creating components and
            libraries that facilitate growth and safe coding. I also work closely with UX to ensure that
            all applications are user friendly, engaging, and accessible to all. I consider myself a UI and
            UX Engineer providing a design-centric approach to programming user interfaces.
