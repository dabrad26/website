            I am always open for new opportunities and experiences to better myself and learn more about software development,
            UX/UI patterns and build tools. This site serves as my resume and portfolio. I showcase my top skills on this site,
            but I am quick at picking up new technology and languages as the need arises; I learn by doing!

            I have been developing software for small businesses and enterprise as a freelancer or employee since 2006.
            I mainly focus on web applications for enterprise, but also work on mobile applications, desktop software and websites.
